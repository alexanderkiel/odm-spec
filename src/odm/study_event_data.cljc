(ns odm.study-event-data
  "3.1.4.1.1 - StudyEventData

  Clinical data for a study event (visit). The model supports repeating study
  events (for example, when the same set of information is collected for a
  series of patient visits).

  The ::study-event-oid and ::study-event-repeat-key are used together to
  identify a particular study event. This pair of values uniquely identifies a
  study event within the containing subject. The ::study-event-repeat-key is
  present if and only if the study event definition is repeating."
