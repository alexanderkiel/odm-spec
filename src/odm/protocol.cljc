  "3.1.1.3.2 - Protocol

  A protocol lists the kinds of study events that can occur within a specific
  version of a study. All clinical data must occur within one of these study
  events.

  Note: A study whose metadata does not contain a protocol definition cannot
  have any clinical data. Such studies can serve as \"common metadata
  dictionaries\" -- allowing sharing of metadata across studies."
