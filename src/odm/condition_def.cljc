  "3.1.1.3.11 - ConditionDef

  A condition-def defines a boolean condition. The description must be provided
  and should include a prose description. This is the normative content of the
  condition-def. The condition-def is referenced by the
  collection-exception-condition-oid attribute within a study metadata
  component which may be omitted under circumstances defined by the condition,
  i.e., when the formal-expression evaluates to true."
